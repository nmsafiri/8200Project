Please note when running installations: the default memory requirement is too small, allocate something like 8gb and you should be fine.

The NetAdapt Library wants Python3.7 and some deps, use an anaconda3 module to avoid installing them yourself.
You will still need to install Torch/Torchvision if you don't have them (pip install --user torch torchvision), and load a cuda 10.0 toolkit


Recommended modules:
anaconda3/5.1.0
cuda-toolkit/10.0.130

The anaconda toolkit still isn't upgraded enough for NetAdapt, so run (pip install --upgrade scipy --user) to get that requirement filled.

You should be able to run the NetAdapt unit tests now, try it with:
sh scripts/unittest.sh
All tests should return "OK", you shouldn't see any "FAIL"

Try running the Netadapt Helloworld test too:
sh scripts/netadapt_helloworld.sh
